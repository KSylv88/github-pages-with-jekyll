# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my journey through learning coding and the marking of my progress!

I'm about 4 days in and while it is somewhat challenging at times, and confusing at others, I'm really enjoying it so far.

## A little bit about how I got here...

After spending years travelling from place to place, trying to find 'the spot' where I want to finally stop and settle down, I realised that it's the moving around that keeps me sane! And so I have been on a mission to try and find a career path that provides me not only with a regular, stable income, but also the freedom and opportunity to travel and live on the road. With Albie, my best pal :)
A friend recently reached out offered me some coaching to help me find my path, we discussed working remotely and looked at pathways that would lead to sustainable work. She introduced me to free online training platforms and also various communities on social media, both of which have been awesome sources of support and inspiration.
